Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification for Task 5 of SemEval-2022, the 16h International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation

This project tackles Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI), as outlined for Task 5 of SemEval-2022, the16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation. It addresses a popular topic of interest in the machine learning and natural language processing research communities -- multimodal inputs, in this case working with both images and text to produce meaningful outputs. The task is to identify misogynistic memes from a dataset that is provided by the challenge organizers.

## Where to find the files?
1. The caption generator files are in `Caption Generator` folder.
2. Overlaid Text removal files are in `Overlaid Text Remover` folder.
3. The BERT implementation files for text features (both overlaid text and captions) are in `Text Embedding` folder.
4. The visual embedding generator files are in `Visual Embedding` folder.

Note: Work still in progress
